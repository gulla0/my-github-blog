**Part 1: Where It All Started**

I’m not a builder. Not yet, anyway. I’m just someone who’s been around long enough to start picking things up — slowly, awkwardly, sometimes accidentally. I still don’t know how to build anything big or meaningful. But I’ve stopped being afraid of trying. And that’s something.

This started a few years ago when I was working at a photography studio. I used to have these long conversations with a close friend — he was an artist, and we’d talk about systems, power, how the world works, that kind of thing. Over time, I started shifting away from some of those ideas. Not because we argued or anything dramatic like that — just from experience. I began to think differently about how change actually happens, and who gets to make it.

That’s when I stumbled across blockchain. I didn’t know how to code. But the idea that you could build systems instead of just talking about them — that pulled me in.

At first, I tried NFTs. Then I made a Catalyst proposal for a Telugu YouTube channel — 24 whiteboard videos to explain blockchain concepts. I finished 15. The channel didn’t really grow, maybe 40 subs total. The funding came in stages, and I used it up trying to make it work. Eventually, I had to stop.

Still, that’s where I learned the basics — what crypto is, how it’s different from fiat, why stablecoins exist. It wasn’t success, but it wasn’t failure either. It was a step.

To stay in the space, I leaned into UX design and research. It was something I could do. I wasn’t building anything, but I could contribute. That kept me going long enough to find Gimbalabs. I joined one of their learning cohorts — PPBL — and started poking around smart contracts. I didn’t understand much at first, but over time, things started making a bit more sense.

I’m still early in the learning curve. I’ve started exploring Aiken, written a bit of validator logic, used Mesh to interact with wallets, and tried to wrap my head around how UTXOs actually work. Most of the time, I’m just experimenting. Sometimes seriously. Sometimes just for fun. My idea of a late night is writing half-broken code while sipping what’s basically hot water with a hint of coffee.

This blog isn’t about arriving anywhere. It’s about learning out loud — documenting what clicks, what confuses me, and what makes me want to keep going.

Because even if I’m not a builder yet, I’ve started walking. And maybe that feeling of being “on the way” never really leaves.
